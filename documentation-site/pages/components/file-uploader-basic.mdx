# File Uploader Basic

<Yard placeholderHeight={180} {...fileUploaderBasicYardConfig} />

Creates a dropzone for file uploads.

## Accessibility

- "Browse files" has `aria-controls="fileupload"` set.

## When to use

- Enable file(s) upload through drag and drop or the system _Browse files_ dialog.

## Security considerations

By default, the file uploader basic does not concern itself with validating and discarding potentially malicious files, as Base Web never runs any of the uploaded files. **It's the responsibility of the consuming application to do so.** To help with that, this component supports the `accept` property, which can limit the acceptable file extensions.
