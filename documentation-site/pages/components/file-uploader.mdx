# File Uploader

<Yard placeholderHeight={120} {...fileUploaderYardConfig} />

Creates a dropzone for file uploads with file row state binding, props to control errors, and props to control uploads.

## Accessibility

- "Browse files" has `aria-controls="fileupload"` set.

## Inheritance

- Inherits all props from the `FileUploaderBasic` component except for `onDrop`, `onDropAccepted`, and `onDropRejected`. These three props are replaced by the `processFileOnDrop` function prop.
- Inherits all style props from the `FileUploaderBasic` component.

## How to use

- Enable file(s) upload through drag and drop or the system _Browse files_ dialog.
- Leverage `accept`, `maxFiles`, `maxSize`, and `minSize` for built in error handling.
- Leverage `processFileOnDrop` for custom error handling and upload capabilities. Should take a `file: File` and input and return `Promise<{ errorMessage: string | null; fileInfo?: any }>` where `errorMessage` determines if an error is shown.
- Component will be `disabled` while files are uploading. This prevents invalid state while React re-renders via `useState` hook.

## Security considerations

By default, the file uploader does not concern itself with validating and discarding potentially malicious files, as Base Web never runs any of the uploaded files. **It's the responsibility of the consuming application to do so.** To help with that, this component supports the `accept` property, which can limit the acceptable file extensions.
