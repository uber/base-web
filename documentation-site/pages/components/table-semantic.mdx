# Table Semantic

<Yard placeholderHeight={202} {...tableYardConfig} />

Display tabular data using semantic markup. This component is best suited for
smaller amounts of data that can be rendered all at once. Gives you access to
the full set of native HTML table features including row and column spans and
dynamic column widths based on cell contents. Newer browsers will also support
fixed table headers which gracefully degrade in older browsers, ensuring your
content is accessible to the greatest number of users.

For larger amounts of information, browser rendering performance can suffer and
you should use the virtualized scrolling features of the div-based
[table](/components/table) or [table-grid](/components/table-grid) components.

## Table vs. TableBuilder

If you want to pass some data in and let the component take care of rendering,
**Table** is the right component. If you want control over how each cell is
rendered, use **TableBuilder** along with **TableBuilderColumn**.

When using **TableBuilder**, you pass data in the same as you would with
**Table**, then you define how each cell (and it's header) should be rendered
by adding a **TableBuilderColumn** for each column. Each **TableBuilderColumn**
takes exactly one child, and that child is a function which a row of data as
input, and outputs a React Node which represents the cell for that column/row
pair. See the [table-builder](#table-builder) example below for a basic example,
and the following table-builder examples for more complex cases, including
customizing the column header.
